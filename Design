//Introduction/Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show and apply principles of Inter-Process Communication(IPC).
This project will expose us to using shared memory, message queues, signals, and working with both sender and receiver processes.

//Project Overview
This project uses IPC in order to synchronously transfer files between two process, a sender and receiver.
The sender will send files to the receiver process and the receiver will receive files from the sender.


//Design Constraints
A constraint that we had was having to use and implement our code into the given skeleton code.
Another constraint was implementing the code into the said diagrams, making sure all key components were correct.
